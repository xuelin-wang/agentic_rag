# Datasets Agent (skeleton)

This subproject contains a lightweight skeleton for an agent that surfaces dataset categories relevant to a user query.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e .` from this directory.
2. Run the demo CLI: `uv run datasets-agent-demo "find climate datasets"`.

## Next Steps

- Replace the in-memory category mapping with a real catalog integration.
- Extend the agent to surface dataset metadata and scoring details.
