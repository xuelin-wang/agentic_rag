# Agent Core (skeleton)

Shared scaffolding for agents to share configuration, context, and orchestration helpers.

## Components

- `context` – Common request/response dataclasses for agent integrations.
- `registry` – Lightweight registry interface for wiring agents together.
- `settings` – Placeholder utilities for applying global agent configuration.

Fill in concrete logic as the agents mature.
