# Knowledge Base (skeleton)

This subproject scaffolds utilities for preparing documents into a query-ready knowledge base.

## Concept

- ingest source documents
- generate chunk summaries and embeddings
- persist artifacts for downstream agents

Real implementations should integrate LlamaIndex or other frameworks as needed.
